# perma.ws 🧊

## What it is

**perma.ws** 🧊 represents the future of decentralized web archiving: provable, verifiable, and permanent. It's a decentralized archiving service that creates cryptographically-attested snapshots of web pages that can never be altered, deleted, or lost.

Every archive on perma.ws includes both a visual screenshot and a high-fidelity interactive archive (WACZ format) that preserves the full experience of the original webpage. But unlike traditional archiving services, every snapshot comes with a cryptographic attestation proving its authenticity.

With perma.ws, you can finally trust that what you're seeing is exactly what existed at that moment in time. The archiving process is provably done in a Nautilus Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), and archives are stored permanently on Walrus decentralized storage.

This creates an immutable record of the web that serves researchers, journalists, legal professionals, and anyone who needs to preserve and prove what a webpage looked like at a specific point in time.

## The Problem We're Solving

Today's web is ephemeral and full of deepfakes:

- **Link rot is everywhere** — Studies show that 50% of links in Supreme Court opinions no longer work. Academic papers, news articles, and legal documents reference pages that vanish without a trace
- **No proof of authenticity** — Screenshots can be faked in Photoshop. Traditional archives can be manipulated. There's no way to prove what you're seeing is real
- **Centralized control** — Centralized archival services can be taken down, censored, or lose data. Your archives depend on their continued existence and goodwill
- **Low fidelity captures** — Most archiving tools only save static HTML, losing JavaScript interactions, dynamic content, and the true user experience
- **No accountability** — When someone claims "the website said X," there's no trustless way to verify that claim

The result? A web where nothing is permanent, nothing is provable, and trust is questionable.

## Our Solution

### 🔒 **Cryptographic Attestation**
Every archive is captured inside a **Nautilus Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)** running on AWS Nitro Enclaves. The TEE cryptographically signs each archive with an **Ed25519 signature**, creating an attestation that proves:
- The exact URL that was archived
- The precise timestamp of capture
- The SHA-256 hash of the screenshot
- The Walrus blob ID of the WACZ archive
- That the capture was performed by genuine TEE hardware, not manipulated software

You can verify the attestation independently. No trust required.

### 🌊 **Permanent Decentralized Storage**
All archives are stored on **Walrus decentralized storage**, ensuring they can never be:
- Deleted by a platform or government
- Lost in a server crash or company shutdown
- Censored by a corporation
- Held hostage behind paywalls or access restrictions

Once stored on Walrus, your archives exist forever. The network guarantees availability even if individual nodes fail.

### 📸 **High-Fidelity Capture**
perma.ws doesn't just save HTML. Every archive includes:
- **Screenshot**: A pixel-perfect visual capture via ScreenshotOne
- **WACZ Archive**: A complete interactive archive generated by Scooper that preserves JavaScript, CSS, images, fonts, and dynamic content
- **Full browsing experience**: Navigate the archived page exactly as it appeared, with working links and interactions

### 🔍 **Independent Verification**
Anyone can verify an archive's authenticity:
1. Download the attestation JSON
2. Verify the Ed25519 signature against the TEE's public key
3. Confirm the screenshot hash matches the stored image
4. Check the Walrus blob ID matches the WACZ archive
5. Validate the timestamp and URL

The math doesn't lie. If the signature is valid, the archive is genuine.

## How It Works

1. **Submit a URL** — Enter any web address you want to archive
2. **TEE Capture** — The Nautilus server running in a Trusted Execution Environment fetches the page, generates a screenshot, and creates a WACZ archive
3. **Cryptographic Signing** — The TEE signs an attestation containing the URL, timestamp, screenshot hash, and Walrus blob ID
4. **Decentralized Storage** — The screenshot and WACZ archive are uploaded to Walrus for permanent storage
5. **Verification** — Anyone can download the attestation and independently verify its authenticity using standard cryptographic tools

## Why perma.ws Will Win

**The current web archiving landscape is broken.** Centralized services can disappear. Screenshots can be faked. Archives can be manipulated. There's no way to prove authenticity.

**perma.ws fixes this** with a simple but powerful combination:
- TEE-based capture → cryptographic proof of authenticity
- Decentralized storage → permanent, censorship-resistant archives
- Open verification → anyone can validate independently
- High-fidelity preservation → complete browsing experience

This isn't just another archiving service. It's the foundation for a **trustless, permanent record of the web** where proof matters more than promises.
